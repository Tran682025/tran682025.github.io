  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the PiChordify Kingdom application (“App”) collects and uses information.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App only collects the minimum information required to operate, including Pi username, Pi user ID, and login status. We do not request or store wallet keys, seed phrases, or balances.</p>

  <h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
  <p>Information is used exclusively to enable App features such as personalized preferences, premium access via Pi payments, and statistics for improving the App.</p>

  <h2>3. Pi Login and Payments</h2>
  <p>Login and payments are provided securely through Pi Network. All transactions are processed directly by Pi Network. The App cannot access, send, or receive Pi outside Pi’s payment system.</p>

  <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
  <p>The App may store preferences locally on your device (localStorage) to improve user experience. This data never leaves your device unless you choose to share it.</p>

  <h2>5. Security and Transparency</h2>
  <p>The App does not sell or share personal information with third parties. No advertising trackers or analytics libraries are used.</p>

  <h2>6. Updates to Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>This policy may change as the App evolves. Continued use of the App implies acceptance of updated terms.</p>

  <h2>7. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about this Privacy Policy, contact the developer through the Pi Browser support page.</p>
